# Dinely :fork_and_knife:

#### What is Dinely? 
Have you ever had a friend asking you for a restaurant recommendation and you just couldn't remember the name of that great place you recently went to? Or have you ever experienced that you knew you went to a certain restaurant but you don't remember if you liked it or not? Dinely is here to the rescue!

Dinely is an app in which you can keep track of all your restaurants. You can add restaurants to your wishlist, and you can review restaurants you already visited. You can very easily find back restaurants based on their rating, location and more!

See the Dinely [frontend repository](https://github.com/annadrg/dinely-frontend) for more information.
